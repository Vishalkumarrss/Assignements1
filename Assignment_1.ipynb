    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",

    "\n",
    "1.In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) uses objects and classes in programming.\n",
    "2.It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "3.The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that \n",
    "  no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "4.It comes up with the following advantages:\n",
    "5.It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the use of objects\n",

    "\n",
    "Class is a template for creating objects whereas object is an instance of class Seperate memory is allocated for each \n",
    "object whenever an object is created but for a class this does not happens.A Class is created once. Many objects are created \n",
